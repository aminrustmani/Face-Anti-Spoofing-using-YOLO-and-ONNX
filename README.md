## ðŸ”¹ Project Description

This project implements a real-time Face Anti-Spoofing system that detects whether a face is real or spoofed (e.g., printed photo, replay attack).
It combines two ONNX models:

YOLOv5 Face Detector (ONNX) â†’ Detects and localizes faces.

Anti-Spoofing Classifier (ONNX) â†’ Classifies each detected face as Real or Spoof.

The system is fully extended for real-time webcam input using OpenCV + ONNX Runtime, making it lightweight, portable, and ready for deployment.

# ðŸ”¹ Features

Real-time webcam-based face anti-spoofing

Accurate face detection with YOLOv5 ONNX

Anti-spoofing classification with pre-trained ONNX model

End-to-end Python pipeline

Annotated results with bounding boxes & labels (Real/Spoof)

# ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack

Python 3.x

OpenCV

NumPy

ONNX Runtime

YOLOv5 (exported to ONNX)

ðŸ”¹ Installation

Clone repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-anti-spoofing-yolo.git
cd face-anti-spoofing-yolo


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


requirements.txt

opencv-python
numpy
onnxruntime

# ðŸ”¹ Usage
Run real-time webcam detection
python src/main.py


Press Q to quit the webcam window.

# ðŸ”¹ Example Output

Bounding box drawn around detected face.

Label above face: Real (0.95) or Spoof (0.87).

Runs in real-time using webcam feed.

# ðŸ”¹ How It Works

Face Detection â†’ YOLOv5 ONNX detects face bounding boxes.

Face Cropping â†’ Extract detected face region.

Spoof Classification â†’ ONNX model predicts Real or Spoof.

Annotation â†’ Results displayed live with bounding boxes & labels.

# ðŸ”¹ Future Improvements

Add multi-face support for crowded scenes.

Optimize for GPU inference.

Export to TensorRT / TFLite / CoreML for deployment on edge devices.
